# Wireframe

  - As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
      - react view that:
      - indexes all polls
      - renders a single poll with an option to vote on it
      - renders a form to create a new poll
      - renders a form to edit a poll

      - get /polls is NOT an authenticated end point
